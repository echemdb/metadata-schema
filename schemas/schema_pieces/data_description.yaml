      $ref: '#/definitions/FieldMapping'
    fieldUnits:
      type: array
      description: List of fields with their units and optional reference electrodes. Describes the physical units of each
        data column after mapping.

Dialect:
  oneOf:
  - type: 'null'
    description: No dialect specification (use defaults or auto-detect).
  - type: object
    additionalProperties: false
    title: dialect
    description: CSV dialect specification describing the format of the source data file.
    properties:
      delimiters:
        type: string
        description: Column delimiter character(s) used in the data file.
        example: ','
      decimal:
        type: string
        description: Character used as decimal separator.
        example: .
      encoding:
        type: string
        description: Character encoding of the data file.
        example: utf-8
      headerLines:
        type: integer
        description: Number of header lines to skip before the column headers.
        example: 5
      columnHeaderLines:
        type: integer
        description: Number of lines that make up the column headers. If more than one, header parts are joined with ' / '.
        example: 2
FieldMapping:
  type: object
  description: Mapping from original column headers in the data file to standardized field names. Keys are the original headers
    (use ' / ' to join multi-line headers), values are the standardized names. Also map fields that should be kept unchanged.
  additionalProperties:
    type: string
    description: Standardized field name.
  example:
    E / V vs. RHE: E
    j / mA cm-2: j

      type: string
      description: Standardized name of the data field (after mapping).
      example: E
    unit:
      type: string
      description: Unit of measurement for this field, using astropy's string representation.
      example: V
    reference:
      type: string
      description: Reference electrode or reference point for this field (electrochemistry-specific).
      example: RHE
    description:
      type: string
      description: Optional detailed description of the field and its physical meaning.
      example: Electrode potential vs. reversible hydrogen electrode
