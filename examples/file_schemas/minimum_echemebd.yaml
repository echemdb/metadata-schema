figureDescription:
  type: not available # raw, digitized, not available (refers to data not extracted from a figure or available as raw data)
  measurementType: CV # default for echemdb
  simultaneousMeasurements:
    - ring current # FTIR, SXRD, Ring Disc - indicate if any other operando methods were shown in the same plot, which is linked to the data. Created by `svgdigitizer.electrochemistry.cv.CV`
  comment: Some unusual observation. # Add whatever you think is important to understand the data.
