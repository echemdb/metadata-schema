# Metadata Schema

Development of a metadata schema for experimental data, specifically electrochemical and electrocatalytic data.

## Install with pip for development

If you want to work on the metadata-schema itself, install [pixi](https://pixi.sh)
and get a copy of the latest unreleased version of the metadata-schema:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/echemdb/metadata-schema.git
cd metadata-schema
```

To validate the example files, run

```sh
pixi run validate
```
